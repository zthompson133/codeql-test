The "database" file is designed to make running CodeQL and updating this repository faster from the zthompson account. It first creates a database called "c_test_db" and then scans C code in the codeql_test directory, and puts the SARIF files in the __codescan directory. The chosen name of the output SARIF file is given as an input argument. The user is then given a choice to update this Github repository, and choose the commit message. The file structure and the Github access token are hardcoded into the program to make running it faster.
